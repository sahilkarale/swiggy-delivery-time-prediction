# üõµ Swiggy Delivery Time Prediction

This project predicts the **delivery time** of food orders on Swiggy using machine learning. It uses structured data such as location, delivery partner information, and order details. The project also integrates **MLflow** for experiment tracking, **DVC** for data versioning, and is deployed on **AWS EC2 with Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** and **AWS CodeDeploy** for scalable, automated deployment.

## üöÄ Project Overview

We aim to accurately predict the `Time_taken(min)` for a food delivery order. This helps improve:
- Delivery time estimations
- Customer satisfaction
- Logistics efficiency

---

## üß† Features Used

- **Delivery Person**: Age, Ratings  
- **Location Data**: Restaurant & Delivery latitude/longitude  
- **Order Type**: Food category, vehicle type  
- **Distance**: Haversine formula used to compute geo-distance

---

## üìä Dataset

- üìÅ Location: `data/raw/delivery_data.csv`  
- üìå Source: Cleaned Kaggle dataset (courtesy of Gaurav Malik)  
- üî¢ Target Column: `Time_taken(min)`  
- üßπ Preprocessing includes:
  - Handling missing values
  - Distance feature calculation
  - One-hot encoding

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Himanshu-1703/swiggy-delivery-time-prediction.git
cd swiggy-delivery-time-prediction
```

### 2. Set up Python environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize DVC and MLflow

```bash
dvc pull   # Pulls versioned data
mlflow ui  # Optional: view experiment dashboard
```

---

## üß† Model Info

The best models identified through MLflow experimentation include:
- ‚úÖ **Random Forest Regressor**
- ‚úÖ **LightGBM Regressor**
- ‚úÖ **Stacking Regressor** combining both above for improved performance

Models are tracked in MLflow and versioned with DVC for reproducibility.

---

## üìà MLflow Usage

To run and log an experiment:
```bash
python src/models/train_model.py
```
View the MLflow dashboard:
```bash
mlflow ui
```

---

## üì¶ DVC Usage

```bash
dvc repro        # Reproduce entire pipeline
dvc push         # Push data/models to remote storage
```

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (AWS CodeDeploy + ASG)

- Dockerized app zipped with `appspec.yml`
